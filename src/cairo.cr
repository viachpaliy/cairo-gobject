#    DIFFERENCE = 23      takes the difference of the source and destination color.  
#    EXCLUSION = 24       produces an effect similar to difference, but with lower contrast.  
#    HSL_HUE = 25         creates a color with the hue of the source and the saturation and luminosity of the target.  
#    HSL_SATURATION = 26  creates a color with the saturation of the source and the hue and luminosity of the target. Painting with this mode onto a gray area prduces no change.  
#    HSL_COLOR = 27       creates a color with the hue and saturation of the source and the luminosity of the target.
#                         This preserves the gray levels of the target and is useful for coloring monochrome images or tinting color images.  
#    HSL_LUMINOSITY = 28  creates a color with the luminosity of the source and the hue and saturation of the target. This produces an inverse effect to CAIRO_OPERATOR_HSL_COLOR.
